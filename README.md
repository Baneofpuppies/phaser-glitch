Welcome to Austen's hackathon!
=================

We'll be building a game today using the glitch platform and the Phaser game engine.

Click `Show` in the header to see your app live. Updates to your code will instantly deploy and update live.



**Phaser** is an awesome JavaScript-based game engine that can run in your browser. It makes 
building 2D games relatively easy and has a lot of features.

Find out more [about Phaser](https://phaser.io)

**Glitch** is the friendly community where you'll build the app of your dreams. Glitch lets you instantly create, remix, edit, and host an app, bot or site, and you can invite collaborators or helpers to simultaneously edit code with you.

Your Project
------------

### ← index.html

This is where the game shows up.

### ← game.js

This is where the main files for this game live. This will be the main place we will be doing our editing.

### ← assets

Drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

### ← phaser.min.js

Don't worry about this file - this is where the game engine lives in the background.
